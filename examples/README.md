# Apollo Timeline Runtimes

These examples demonstrate building scenes/animations using JSON and the Apollo Timeline.

The `aeProject` is kept to use as an example of when/how the runtimes are applied.

Not everything is doable when recreating After Effects to interactive, as seen when comparing different runtimes.


### Runtimes

[PIXI Demo](http://tomorrowevening.github.io/Apollo-Timeline/examples/PIXI/dist/index.html)

[THREE Demo](http://tomorrowevening.github.io/Apollo-Timeline/examples/THREE/dist/index.html)

Each runtime uses a copy of the `aeProject/project.json` to use to demonstrate its capabilities.
